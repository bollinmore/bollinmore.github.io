### License Identifier

A document with a single license is defined by **SPDX-License-Identifier**, for example:  
```
SPDX-License-Identifier: CDDL-1.0+
SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
```

Some commonly found licenses have been defined in the [SPDX License List](https://spdx.org/licenses/), it represents in a short form.  

However, we might want to declare a private license, so a user defined license would be represented by **LicenseRef-<idstring>**. (`idstring = 1*(ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "." )`). If a license of a file was claimed as *LicenseRef-2*, and its license was defined in other file, then the copy of actual text will be filled in the field -- **ExtractedText**.
